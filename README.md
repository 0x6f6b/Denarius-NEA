This is a project where I implemented a distributed ledger using JavaScript and ElectronJS. The ledger uses Proof-of-Work and the account model to a degree.

Please note that this is not a production-ready project, and it is not intended for real-world use.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript/NodeJS
- ElectronJS
- WebRTC via PeerJS
- LevelDB
