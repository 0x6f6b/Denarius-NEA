# Denarius NEA: Distributed Ledger using WebRTC and ElectronJS

This is a project for my A-Level Computer Science course where I implemented a distributed ledger using JavaScript and ElectronJS. The ledger uses Proof-of-Work and the account model to a degree. 

Please note that this is not a production-ready project, and it is not intended for real-world use. As an A-Level student, I have limited knowledge and skills, and there may be many issues that I am not equipped to deal with.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript/NodeJS
- ElectronJS
- WebRTC via PeerJS
- LevelDB

## How to Use

To use this project, you can download or clone the repository and run it using the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Please note that a PeerJS signaling server may be required for certain networking features. You can find more information about PeerJS and how to set up a signaling server on their website.

## Releases

In the future, I plan to include installers for this project in the Releases section of this repository.
