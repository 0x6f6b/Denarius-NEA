## Description

This is a project where I implemented a distributed ledger using JavaScript and ElectronJS. The ledger uses Proof-of-Work and the account model to a degree.

Please note that this is not a production-ready project, and it is not intended for real-world use. As an A-Level student, I have limited knowledge and skills, and there may be many issues that I am not equipped to deal with.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript/NodeJS
- ElectronJS
- WebRTC via PeerJS
- LevelDB

## How to Use

To use this project, you can download or clone the repository and run it using the following commands:

```javascript
npm install
npm start
```

Please note that a PeerJS signaling server may be required for certain networking features. You can find more information about PeerJS and how to set up a signaling server on their website.

## Releases

In the future, I plan to include installers for this project in the Releases section of this repository.

## Disclaimer

This project is not intended for real-world use and is solely created for educational purposes. The code may contain vulnerabilities, and I take no responsibility for any issues that may arise from its usage. Please use at your own risk.

The current name of the project is Denarius, but this is just a placeholder name and is subject to change. In the case of this project, the name Denarius was chosen as a reference to a Roman coin that was widely used during the ancient times. While the name may have some historical significance, it does not reflect the purpose or functionality of the program.
